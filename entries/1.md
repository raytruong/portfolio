# About this site

---

This journal area is meant to be a small corner of the world to keep track of anything and everything I discover. Photography, travel, tech, food, gaming, and whatever my attention span directs me to ramble about will be all found here. The goal is to have fun, reflect, and take time to remember.

This site was made with Vue and Nuxt. This journal area uses frontmatter markdown for each entry and dynamic routing through Vue to generate each page.
